The folder config contains the configuration files for the tables and plots in arXiv:1907.04311v1. The runfile will generate all the necessary variation. The runfile* has some more variations not used in the final results. NOTE: CLIC SM parameters do not correspond to the ones in the table of the arXiv:1907.04311v1.
